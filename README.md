# Project Title: Build a chatbot based on BERT [1] and the SQuAD 2.0 dataset [2]

In the project, you will explore deep learning techniques for question answering on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD 2.0) [2]. The project is designed to enable you to dive right into deep learning experiments without spending too much time getting set up. You will have the chance to implement current state-of-the-art techniques (such as BERT) and experiment with your own novel designs.

The goal of this project is to produce a question answering system that works well on SQuAD 2.0. We have provided code for preprocessing the data and computing the evaluation metrics, and code to train a fully-functional neural baseline. Your job is to build an application based on BERT and dataset.

# Stage I

  - Literature Review
  - Basic NLP concept, such as transformer, attetion-based model
  - Self-learning Python
  
# Stage II

  - Code Review
  - Setup Experimental Environment
  - Sample Code Implementation
  
# Stage III

  - Build chatbot model based on Stage I
  - Build chatbot application based on the model and Stage II
